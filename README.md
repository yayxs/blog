# Blog Collection

A website project that showcases personal technical blog articles.

## Background

Since starting work in 2019, I've written many blog articles that haven't had a systematic place for display. These contents are distributed across different GitHub repositories, in both MD and MDX formats, with some content stored locally on my computer. This necessitated the development of a website with excellent SEO and server-side rendering, providing an elegant interface for displaying blog posts to end users.
